The company shows excellent fundamentals (ROE: 28%, revenue growth: 18%) and is currently undervalued. Technical indicators support entry: RSI at 65 (not overbought), MACD showing bullish crossover, and price above all major moving averages. Stop loss at $145 (-3.3%) protects against false breakout, while take profit at $165 (+10%) targets next resistance level. Risk/reward ratio of 3:1 is favorable.",
